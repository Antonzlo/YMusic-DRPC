## Welcome!

If you open this page, it means that you wanted to help our project in some way.
Below you will see useful information in order to understand exactly how to do this. Good luck!

## Commit information

If you already understand Git, below is just a guide for beginners.
The only important thing is that we use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Good luck!

### Useful for beginners

First of all, read the README to understand what our project is aimed at. There are several links below that you can use to learn how to work with Open Source:

-   [Git Simulator](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
-   [Basics of working with Github](https://habr.com/en/companies/yandex_praktikum/articles/700708/) (skip the SSH section)

## The beginning

First you have to decide what you're going to do.

### Issues

**Issue** is a way to report a bug or ask a question to developers.
Before you ask any question, **check if someone else has asked it!**

#### Open a new issue

If your question/error is not a duplicate of another issue, feel free to open a new one.
Try to tell us in detail what your question/mistake is. If this is an error, provide as much information as possible about your work environment, about the application, about the version, etc.
If you have opened an issue, try to check it sometimes, you may be asked to send additional information.
If you've found a solution yourself, don't be shy! Write it in the issue and close it as resolved.

#### Help in solving an already open issue

### Pull requests

**Pull request** (sometimes called pull request) is a request that tells developers that you have made changes to the code and want these changes to get into the code.
Pull request gives you a lot of opportunities, but responsibility is also important.

#### Creating the first commit

**Commit** is a way to save changes in the code.

-   Download any GUI client for Git, for example, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Here [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) you can find out how to use this program.
-   Next, you will need [форкнуть](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository) repository.
-   Open your favorite code editor, for example, VS Code, make the changes that you wanted to make.
-   Save the changes in the code editor.
-   Go to Github Desktop, it will prompt you to commit.
-   Make the commit header according to [template](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Creating a Pull request

Before creating it, check if everything is working correctly?
Follow [this гайду](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to make a Pull request.
If you suddenly see that you haven't done everything, don't worry! Write about it on the Pull request page and just finish everything you need!
If you realize that you need more time to finish the work, also let us know.

#### Your PR (Pull request) has been accepted!

Congratulations! Your changes will appear in the code soon, and later in a new update. Thank you for your contribution!
